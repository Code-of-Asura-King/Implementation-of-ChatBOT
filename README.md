# Implementation-of-ChatBOT using NLP
AICTE project of AI/ML


This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project is designed to run in a Google Colab environment and leverages popular libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

## Installation

To install the necessary modules, run the following command in your Colab notebook:

```bash
!pip install nltk scikit-learn streamlit
This will install:

NLTK: A toolkit for natural language processing.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for text vectorization and classification.
Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web applications.
Setup and Configuration
Importing Libraries
Import the required Python libraries:


import nltk
import random
import os
import ssl
import streamlit as st
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
SSL Configuration
Override Python’s default HTTPS context to bypass SSL certificate verification. This is helpful in avoiding issues during resource downloads:


ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
NLTK Data Setup
Append a local directory to NLTK’s data search path and download the punkt tokenizer, which is essential for tokenizing sentences and words:


nltk.data.path.append(os.path.abspath('nltk_data'))
nltk.download('punkt')
Chatbot Intents
The chatbot uses predefined intents to understand and respond to user queries. Each intent is represented as a dictionary with three keys:

tag: A unique identifier for the intent.
patterns: Sample phrases that a user might say to trigger this intent.
responses: Predefined replies that the chatbot can use when the intent is recognized.
